### DESCRIPTION 

!!! info "What is the requirement of the project?"

    - The project aims to perform colorization of black and white images.
    - It involves in showcase the capabilities of OpenCV's DNN module and caffe models.
    - It is done by processing given image using openCV and use Lab Color space model to hallucinate an approximation of how colorized version of the image "might look like".

??? info "Why is it necessary?"

- It helps preserving historical black-and-white photos. 
- It can be used adding color to grayscale images for creative industries.  
- It acts an advancing computer vision applications in artistic and research fields.

??? info "How is it beneficial and used?"

- **Personal use :** It helps in restoring old family photographs.  
- **Cultural and Political :** it also enhances grayscale photographs of important historic events for modern displays. 
- **Creativity and Art  :** it improves AI-based creative tools for artists and designers.  

??? info "How did you start approaching this project? (Initial thoughts and planning)"

- **Initial approach** : reading various research papers and analyze different approaches on how to deal with this project.

### EXPLANATION 

#### DETAILS OF THE DIFFERENT FEATURES 

\- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses the Caffe-based neural network for colorization.  

\- **LAB Color Space**: Converts input grayscale images to LAB, where the model predicts A and B channels.  

\- **Cluster Centers**: Provides color information for prediction using `pts_in_hull.npy`.

#### PROJECT WORKFLOW 

=== "Step 1"

    Initial data exploration and understanding:
    
      - Load the grayscale input image.
      - Load pre-trained caffe models using openCV dnn module.

=== "Step 2"

    Data cleaning and preprocessing:
    
      - Preprocess image to normalize and convert to LAB color space.
      - Resize image for the network.
      - Split L channel and perform mean subtraction.
      - Predict ab channel from the input of L channel.

=== "Step 3"

    Feature engineering and selection:
    
      - Resize predicted ab channel's volume to same dimension as our image.
      - Join L and predicted ab channel.
      - Convert image from Lab back to RGB.

=== "Step 4"

    Result : 
    
    - Resize and Show the Original and Colorized image. 

=== "Step 5"

```code languageÂ 
Model Validation :

- This system cannot be validated as the colorization is a result of hallucination.
```

#### PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS 

=== "Trade Off 1"

- Computational efficiency vs. color accuracy.  
- **Solution : **Used optimized preprocessing pipelines to reduce runtime. 

=== "Trade Off 2"

- Pre-trained model generalization vs. custom training.  
- **Solution : **Choose the pre-trained model for faster implementation and reliable results.
