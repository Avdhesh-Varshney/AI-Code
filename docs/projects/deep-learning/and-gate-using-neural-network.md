## üîç PROJECT EXPLANATION 

### üõ§ PROJECT WORKFLOW 
<!-- Draft a visualization graph of your project workflow using mermaid -->

!!! success "Project workflow"

    ``` mermaid
      graph LR
        A[Start] --> C[Create Perceptron Model]
        C --> D[Train the Model]
        D --> E[Evaluate Performance]
        E --> F[End]
    ```

<!-- Clearly define the step-by-step workflow followed in the project. You can add or remove points as necessary. -->
=== "Step 1"
    - Define the input-output pairs for the AND gate.

=== "Step 2"
    - Implement a single-layer perceptron model.

=== "Step 3"
    - Train the model using supervised learning with gradient descent.

=== "Step 4"
    - Evaluate the model's accuracy in predicting AND gate outputs.

=== "Step 5"  
    - Test the trained model with different inputs.

### üñ• CODE EXPLANATION 
=== "Perceptron Model"
    - Implemented using NumPy and TensorFlow/Keras.
    - Uses a single-layer neural network with sigmoid activation.


--- 

### ‚öñÔ∏è PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS 
=== "Trade Off 1"
- Accuracy vs. Simplicity: A single-layer perceptron is sufficient for the AND gate but cannot handle more complex problems like XOR.
- Solution: Use multi-layer perceptrons for non-linearly separable problems.
