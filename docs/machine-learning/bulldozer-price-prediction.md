## üìù DESCRIPTION 

Requirement of the Project

The project aims to predict the price of used bulldozers based on various factors such as equipment type, usage hours, manufacturing year, and other relevant parameters. The goal is to develop an accurate pricing model using Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

Why is it Necessary?

The construction and heavy machinery industry heavily relies on the resale of used equipment. Incorrect pricing can lead to financial losses for sellers or overpriced purchases for buyers. A data-driven approach helps ensure fair pricing, improving efficiency in the marketplace.

How is it Beneficial and Used?

1. Helps businesses and individuals estimate bulldozer prices before buying or selling.

2. Assists construction companies in budgeting for equipment procurement.

3. Enables auction houses and dealerships to set competitive and data-backed prices.

4. Reduces reliance on manual estimation, making pricing more transparent and objective.

Approach to the Project

**Data Collection** ‚Äì Gathered historical sales data of bulldozers, including features like sale date, equipment age, and location.

**Data Preprocessing** ‚Äì Cleaned missing values, handled categorical variables, and transformed data for ML models.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Identified key factors influencing bulldozer prices.

**Model Selection & Training** ‚Äì Implemented and evaluated various ML models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression.

**Evaluation & Optimization** ‚Äì Tuned hyperparameters and tested model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

**Deployment** ‚Äì Integrated the trained model into a user-friendly interface for real-world use.

This project ensures a more systematic and accurate approach to bulldozer pricing, leveraging ML to enhance decision-making in the heavy equipment industry.
