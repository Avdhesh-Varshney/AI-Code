## DESCRIPTION

Provide a comprehensive overview of the project:

- **What is the requirement of the project?**
- The project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data.
- This involves extracting tweets related to specific topics or keywords, processing these tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to determine the sentiment (positive or negative), and presenting insights derived from the analysis.

- **Why is it necessary?**
- Twitter is a rich source of real-time public opinion and sentiment. Analyzing tweets can provide valuable insights into public perception of events, products, brands, or topics of interest.
- This information is crucial for businesses, governments, and researchers to make informed decisions, understand public sentiment trends, and gauge the success of marketing campaigns or policy changes.

- **How is it beneficial and used?**
- Business Insights: Companies can understand customer feedback and sentiments towards their products or services.
- Brand Management: Monitor brand sentiment and respond to customer concerns or issues in real-time.
- Market Research: Identify trends and sentiments related to specific topics or industries.
- Social Listening: Understand public opinion on current events, policies, or social issues.
- Customer Service Improvement: Improve customer service by analyzing sentiment towards customer interactions.

- **How did you start approaching this project? (Initial thoughts and planning)**
- Choose appropriate NLP techniques for sentiment analysis, such as:

  - Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF: Represent tweets as numerical vectors.
  - Sentiment Lexicons: Use dictionaries of words annotated with sentiment scores (e.g., Vader sentiment lexicon).
  - Machine Learning Models: Train supervised classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or neural networks) on labeled data for sentiment prediction.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model using metrics like accuracy. Cross-validation techniques can be used to ensure robustness.

- Visualization and Insights: Visualize sentiment trends over time or across different categories using charts (e.g., line plots, bar charts). Generate insights based on the analysis results.

- Deployment: Deploy the sentiment analysis system as a standalone application or integrate it into existing systems for real-time monitoring and analysis.

### EXPLANATION

### DETAILS OF THE DIFFERENT FEATURES

Describe the key features of the project, explaining each one in detail.

### WHAT I HAVE DONE

Outline the steps taken during the project:

1. **Step 1: Initial data exploration and understanding:**

    - Gathered Twitter data using pre-existing datasets (Kaggle).
    - Understand the structure of the data (e.g., tweet text, metadata like timestamps, user information).
    - Explore basic statistics and distributions of data features.

2.**Step 2: Data cleaning and preprocessing:**

    - Remove or handle noisy data such as URLs, special characters, and emojis.
    - Tokenize tweets into individual words or tokens.
    - Remove stopwords (commonly used words that do not carry significant meaning).
    - Normalize text through techniques like stemming to reduce variations of words.

3.**Step 3: Feature engineering and selection:**

    - Convert text data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models (e.g., Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF).
    - Select relevant features that contribute most to the sentiment analysis task.

4.**Step 4: Model training and evaluation:**

    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - Choose appropriate machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, RNN LSTM, logistic regression) for sentiment analysis.
    - Train the models on the training data and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy.

5.**Step 5: Model optimization and fine-tuning:**

    - Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected models to improve performance.
    - Consider techniques like grid search or random search to find optimal parameters.
    - Experiment with different models or combinations of models to achieve better results.

6.**Step 6: Validation and testing:**

    - Validate the trained models on a separate validation set to ensure generalizability.
    - Test the final model on unseen data (testing set or new tweets) to assess its performance in real-world scenarios.
    - Iterate on the model and preprocessing steps based on validation results to improve accuracy and robustness.

### PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS

Discuss the trade-offs faced during the project and the solutions implemented to manage them:

1. **Trade-off 1**: Stemming process took a lot of computational time to process over 1.6 million datapoints.

    - **Solution**: Divided the data into batches and applied parallel processing.

2. **Trade-off 2**: In RNN based LSTM, overfitting problem occurred.

    - **Solution**: Tried to fix it using Dropout layer, early stopping criteria.
