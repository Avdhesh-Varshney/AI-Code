### PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS
<!-- Explain the trade-offs encountered during the project and how you addressed them -->
Discuss the trade-offs faced during the project and the solutions implemented to manage them:
1. **Trade-off 1**: Describe the trade-off encountered (e.g., accuracy vs. computational efficiency).
   - **Solution**: Explain how you addressed this trade-off (e.g., by optimizing hyperparameters, using a more efficient algorithm, etc.).
2. **Trade-off 2**: Describe another trade-off (e.g., model complexity vs. interpretability).
   - **Solution**: Explain the solution (e.g., by selecting a model that balances both aspects effectively).
