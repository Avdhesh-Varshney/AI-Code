#### PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS 


=== "Trade Off 1"
    - Accuracy vs. Interpretability
      - Complex models like Random Forests or Neural Networks offer higher accuracy but are less interpretable compared to simpler models like Logistic Regression.
=== "Trade Off 2"
    - Overfitting vs. Generalization
      -  Models with high complexity may overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.
