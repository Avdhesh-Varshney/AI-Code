### üõ§ PROJECT WORKFLOW 

!!! success "Project workflow"

    ``` mermaid
      graph LR
        A[Start] --> B{Generate Data};
        B --> C[Normalize Data];
        C --> D[Create Sequences];
        D --> E[Train LSTM Autoencoder];
        E --> F[Compute Reconstruction Error];
        F --> G[Identify Anomalies];
    ```

=== "Step 1"
    - Generate synthetic data (sine wave with noise)
    - Normalize data using MinMaxScaler
    - Split data into training and validation sets

=== "Step 2"
    - Create sequential data using a rolling window approach
    - Reshape data for LSTM compatibility

=== "Step 3"
    - Implement LSTM autoencoder for anomaly detection
    - Optimize model using Adam optimizer

=== "Step 4"
    - Compute reconstruction error for anomaly detection
    - Identify threshold for anomalies using percentile-based method

=== "Step 5"
    - Visualize detected anomalies using Matplotlib

### üñ• CODE EXPLANATION 

=== "LSTM Autoencoder"
    - The model consists of an encoder, bottleneck, and decoder.
    - It learns normal time-series behavior and reconstructs it.
    - Deviations from normal patterns are considered anomalies.

### ‚öñÔ∏è PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS 

=== "Reconstruction Error Threshold Selection"
    - Setting a high threshold may miss subtle anomalies, while a low threshold might increase false positives.
    - **Solution**: Use the 95th percentile of reconstruction errors as the threshold to balance false positives and false negatives.
