### üõ§ PROJECT WORKFLOW 

!!! success "Project workflow"

    ``` mermaid
    graph LR
    A[Data Collection] --> B[Data Cleaning]
    B --> C[Exploratory Data Analysis]
    C --> D[Data Visualization]
    D --> E[Conclusion & Insights]
    ```

=== "Step 1"
    **Data Loading and Preprocessing**

        - Importing the dataset using Pandas and checking the initial structure.

        - Converting data types and renaming columns for consistency.

=== "Step 2"
    **Handling Missing Values and Outliers**

        - Identifying and filling/removing missing values using appropriate techniques.

        - Detecting and treating outliers using boxplots and statistical methods.

=== "Step 3"
    **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas and Seaborn**

        - Understanding the distribution of key features through summary statistics.

        - Using groupby functions to analyze purchasing behavior based on demographics.

=== "Step 4"
    **Creating Visualizations for Insights**

        - Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.

        - Creating correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.

=== "Step 5"
    **Identifying Trends and Patterns**

        - Analyzing seasonal variations in sales data.

        - Understanding the impact of age, gender, and occupation on purchase amounts.

=== "Step 6"
    **Conclusion and Final Report**

        - Summarizing the key findings from EDA.

        - Presenting actionable insights for business decision-making.

### üñ• CODE EXPLANATION 

=== "plotgraph() function"

    ```py
    gender_sales = df.groupby('Gender')['Purchase'].sum()

    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
    plt.pie(gender_sales, labels=gender_sales.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140, textprops={'fontsize': 14})
    plt.title('Sales by Gender', fontsize=16)

    plt.show()

    age_gender_sales = df.groupby(['Age', 'Gender'])['Purchase'].sum().unstack()

    age_gender_sales.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(12, 6))
    plt.title('Sales by Age Group and Gender')
    plt.xlabel('Age Group')
    plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.legend(title='Gender')
    plt.show()
    ```

    - It displays the visualization graph of sales by age group and gender.

### ‚öñÔ∏è PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS 

=== "Trade Off 1"
    - **Trade-off:** High computational time due to large dataset.
    - **Solution:** Used optimized Pandas functions to enhance performance.

=== "Trade Off 2"
    - **Trade-off:** Data Imbalance due to customer distribution.
    - **Solution:** Applied statistical techniques to handle biases.
