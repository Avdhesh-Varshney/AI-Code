# Product Detection

## Overview
This repository provides a solution for product detection using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The project leverages deep learning models to detect and classify products from images or video streams. It is suitable for applications in inventory management, retail analytics, and e-commerce.

## Features
- **Product Detection**: Identifies and locates products within images and videos.
- **Product Classification**: Classifies detected products based on pre-trained models.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Supports real-time video processing for dynamic environments.
- **Customizable**: Allows fine-tuning to specific product datasets and use cases.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on model used)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
