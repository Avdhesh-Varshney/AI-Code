### Model Architecture
    - The LSTM autoencoder learns normal time-series behavior and reconstructs it. Any deviation is considered an anomaly.
    - Encoder: Extracts patterns using LSTM layers.
    - Bottleneck: Compresses the data representation.
    - Decoder: Reconstructs the original sequence.
    - The reconstruction error determines anomalies.

### Model Structure
    - Input: Time-series sequence (50 time steps)
    - LSTM Layers for encoding
    - Repeat Vector to retain sequence information
    - LSTM Layers for decoding
    - TimeDistributed Dense Layer for reconstruction
    - Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

=== "Step 4"

    Modeling

    - Train an LSTM autoencoder
    - Optimize loss function using Adam optimizer
    - Monitor validation loss for overfitting prevention

=== "Step 5"

    Result Analysis

    - Compute reconstruction error for anomaly detection
    - Identify threshold for anomalies using percentile-based method
    - Visualize detected anomalies using Matplotlib

#### PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS 

=== "Trade Off 1"

    **Reconstruction Error Threshold Selection:**
    Setting a high threshold may miss subtle anomalies, while a low threshold might increase false positives.

    - **Solution**: Use the 95th percentile of reconstruction errors as the threshold to balance false positives and false negatives.
