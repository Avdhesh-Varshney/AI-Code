# SMS Spam Detection
The SMS spam detection project involves creating a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate.
This project will utilize a dataset of labeled SMS messages for training and testing. The process includes preprocessing the text data to remove noise, extracting relevant features such as word frequencies and patterns, and selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm for classification. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ultimate goal is to deploy a reliable spam detection system that can effectively filter out spam messages in real-time applications.
