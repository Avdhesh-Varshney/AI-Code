# Counting Bicep Reps


### AIM 
To track and count bicep curls in real time using computer vision techniques with OpenCV and Mediapipe's Pose module.

### DATASET LINK 
This project does not use a specific dataset as it works with real-time video from a webcam.

### EXPLANATION 

#### DETAILS OF THE DIFFERENT FEATURES 
    - Pose Estimation: Utilized Mediapipe's Pose module to detect key landmarks on the human body.
    - Angle Calculation: Calculated angles at the elbow joints to determine curl movement.
    - Rep Tracking: Incremented rep count when alternating between full curl and relaxed positions.
    - Real-Time Feedback: Displayed the remaining curl count on the video feed.

#### PROJECT WORKFLOW 

=== "Step 1"
    Initial setup:
- Installed OpenCV and Mediapipe.
- Set up a webcam feed for video capture.  


=== "Step 2"
    Pose detection:
- Used Mediapipe's Pose module to identify body landmarks.


=== "Step 3"
    Angle calculation:
- Implemented a function to calculate the angle between shoulder, elbow, and wrist.


=== "Step 4"
    Rep detection:
- Monitored elbow angles to track upward and downward movements.


=== "Step 5"
    Real-time feedback:
- Displayed the remaining number of curls on the video feed using OpenCV.


=== "Step 6"
    Completion:
- Stopped the program when the target reps were completed or on manual exit.

#### PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS 

=== "Trade Off 1"
    - Accuracy vs. Simplicity:
        - Using elbow angles alone may not handle all body postures but ensures simplicity.
        - Solution: Fine-tuned angle thresholds and added tracking for alternating arms.

=== "Trade Off 2"
    - Real-Time Performance vs. Model Complexity:
        - Mediapipe's lightweight solution ensured smooth processing over heavier models.
