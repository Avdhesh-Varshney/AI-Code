=== "Step 1"
    - Read and explore all datasets individually.
    - Started with `bpl.csv`, analyzing its structure and features.
    - Researched dataset attributes through Google and Bangladesh cricket series data.
    - Reviewed relevant Kaggle notebooks to gain insights from existing work.

=== "Step 2"
    - Performed basic EDA to understand data distribution.
    - Identified and handled missing values.
    - Converted categorical features into numerical representations to enrich analysis.
    - Examined dataset properties using `info()` and `describe()` functions.

=== "Step 3"
    - Developed a custom function `plotValueCounts(df, col, size=(10,5))` to visualize feature distributions.
    - This function, built using Seaborn and Matplotlib, plays a key role in extracting insights.
    - Generates count plots with labeled bar values for better interpretability.

=== "Step 4"
    - Refined `bpl.csv` by merging teams with their respective divisions to prevent duplicate counting.
    - Addressed inconsistencies:
        - Resolved two tie matches recorded in the dataset.
        - Extracted team runs and wickets from match scoreboards and transformed them into numerical features.

=== "Step 5"
    - Implemented automated querying using the `plotValueCounts()` function.
    - Performed grouped analysis of winners by seasons.

#### ‚ùì KEY QUERIES 

- **Key Queries on `bpl.csv` Dataset:**
    - *Won the toss, took the bat first and won the match.*
    - *Won the toss, took the bat first.*
    - *Winning rate by taking `bat first` vs `field first`.*
- **Key Queries on `batsman.csv` Dataset:**
    - *Batsman who scored more than 1 century or more in a match.*
    - *Batsman who faced 50 balls or more in a match.*
    - *Batsman hit more than 10 fours.*
- **Key Queries on `bowler.csv` Dataset:**
    - *Bowler conceded 50 runs or more*
    - *Bowler took more than 4 wickets*
    - *Bowler delivered 4 wide or more*

### üñ• CODE EXPLANATION 

=== "plotValueCounts() function"

    ```py
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    def plotValueCounts(df, col, size=(10, 5)):
        val_counts = df[col].value_counts()
        plt.figure(figsize=size)
        ax = sns.countplot(y=col, data=df, order=val_counts.index, palette="pastel")
        for container in ax.containers:
            ax.bar_label(container, fmt='%d', label_type='edge', padding=3, fontsize=10, color='black')
        plt.title(f"Value Counts of {col}")
        plt.show()
    ```

    - It displays the visualization graph of value counts of any feature of the dataset.

### ‚öñÔ∏è PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS 

=== "Trade Off 1"
    - **Trade-off:** The dataset includes multiple sources, but some features required external validation (e.g., team names, score formats).
    - **Solution:** Standardized team names and resolved inconsistencies by merging duplicate team entries based on divisions.

=== "Trade Off 2"
    - **Trade-off:** Performing detailed feature engineering (e.g., extracting runs, wickets, and match insights) can increase computational overhead.
    - **Solution:** Optimized preprocessing by transforming scoreboard data into structured numerical features, reducing redundant calculations.

=== "Trade Off 3"
    - **Trade-off:** Count plots with high-cardinality features could lead to cluttered or unreadable visualizations.
    - **Solution:** Implemented `plotValueCounts()` with bar labels and sorting to enhance clarity while retaining key insights.

=== "Trade Off 4"
    - **Trade-off:** Writing fixed queries could limit adaptability when new data is introduced.
    - **Solution:** Developed a function-based querying approach (e.g., `plotValueCounts(df, col)`) to enable flexible, real-time insights.
