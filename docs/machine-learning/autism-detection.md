| `ethnicity`        | Ethnic background                                  | `object`    |
| `jaundice`        | Whether the individual had jaundice at birth (`yes/no`) | `object`    |
| `austim`          | Family history of autism (`yes/no`)                 | `object`    |
| `contry_of_res`   | Country of residence                                | `object`    |
| `used_app_before` | Whether the individual used a screening app before (`yes/no`) | `object`    |
| `result`         | Score calculated based on the screening test        | `float64`   |
| `age_desc`       | Age description (e.g., "18 and more")               | `object`    |
| `relation`       | Relation of the person filling out the form          | `object`    |
| `Class/ASD`      | ASD diagnosis label (`1` for ASD, `0` for non-ASD)   | `int64`     |

This dataset provides essential features for training a model to detect ASD based on questionnaire responses and demographic information.

### üõ† PROJECT WORKFLOW
!!! success "Project workflow"
    ``` mermaid
      graph LR
        A[Start] --> B[Data Preprocessing];
        B --> C[Feature Engineering];
        C --> D[Model Training];
        D --> E[Model Evaluation];
        E --> F[Deployment];
    ```

=== "Step 1"
    - Collected dataset and performed exploratory data analysis.

=== "Step 2"
    - Preprocessed data (handling missing values, encoding categorical data).

=== "Step 3"
    - Feature selection and engineering.

=== "Step 4"
    - Trained multiple classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).

=== "Step 5"
    - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### üñ•Ô∏è CODE EXPLANATION
=== "Section 1: Data Preprocessing"
    - Loaded dataset and handled missing values.

=== "Section 2: Model Training"
    - Implemented Logistic Regression and Neural Networks for classification.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS
=== "Trade Off 1"
    - **Accuracy vs. Model Interpretability**: Used a Random Forest model instead of a deep neural network for better interpretability.

=== "Trade Off 2"
    - **Speed vs. Accuracy**: Chose Logistic Regression for quick predictions in real-time applications.
