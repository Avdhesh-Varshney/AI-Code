### EXPLANATION 

#### DETAILS OF THE DIFFERENT FEATURES 

    - Haar Cascade Classifier: A machine learning-based approach for detecting objects in images or video. It works by training on a large set of positive and negative images of faces.
    - Cascade Classifier*: The classifier works through a series of stages, each aimed at increasing detection accuracy.
    - Face Detection: The primary feature of this project is detecting human faces in static images, which is the first step in many facial recognition systems.
