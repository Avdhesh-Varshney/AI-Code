#### PROJECT WORKFLOW 

### 1.Problem Definition

Identify the objective: To predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on patient data.
Define the outcome variable (target) and input features.

### 2.Data Collection

Gather a reliable dataset, such as the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which includes features relevant to heart disease prediction.

### 3.Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values: Fill or remove records with missing data.
Normalize/standardize data to ensure all features have comparable scales.
Encode categorical variables like sex, cp, and thal using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### 4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize data distributions using histograms, boxplots, or density plots.
Identify relationships between features using correlation matrices and scatterplots.
Detect and handle outliers to improve model performance.

### 5.Feature Selection

Use statistical methods or feature importance metrics to identify the most relevant features for prediction.
Remove redundant or less significant features.

### 6.Data Splitting

Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets (e.g., 70%-15%-15%).
Ensure a balanced distribution of the target variable in all splits.

### 7.Model Selection

Experiment with multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
Select models based on the complexity and nature of the dataset.

#### PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS 


=== "Trade Off 1"
    - Accuracy vs. Interpretability
      - Complex models like Random Forests or Neural Networks offer higher accuracy but are less interpretable compared to simpler models like Logistic Regression.
=== "Trade Off 2"
    - Overfitting vs. Generalization
      -  Models with high complexity may overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.
